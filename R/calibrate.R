# Parameterisation, thresholds, and mechanistic generating models.
#
# OWNER: workstream (c), mechanistic models. Contract in INTERFACES.md.
#
# Every duration in this project is a statement about a threshold, reached by
# a trajectory carrying particular parameter values. Change either and every
# number changes with it, which makes the parameterisation a first-class part
# of the analysis rather than a preliminary. The same goes for the assay
# quantification limits: censoring in the tail removes exactly the
# measurements that identify the slow half-life.
#
# This workstream owns three things. The parameter values and thresholds:
# confirming that what the configuration transcribes from the handout is
# defensible and internally consistent, and producing the sensitivity runs
# that show how much the conclusions depend on it. The mechanistic generating
# models, which produce data whose shape the fitted families do not exactly
# contain, so that model misspecification can be studied rather than assumed
# away. And the optional link from an antibody trajectory to a protection
# curve, which makes explicit that antibody persistence and protection are
# related but not the same thing (handout Section 2).
#
# The mechanistic models are generators, not candidate fitted families: the
# families in R/models.R stay frozen and shared, and workstream (b) owns which
# of them are fitted.

#' Check that a configuration's calibration hangs together.
#'
#' The starting values, the threshold and the assay scale come from different
#' sources, and they have to be on the same scale to mean anything. Verify
#' that they are: that the marker is expressed relative to the mean
#' convalescent level, that the threshold sits below the early level, and that
#' the implied duration is a plausible extrapolation rather than an artefact.
#'
#' @return a data frame of checks with pass/fail and a short reason, so the
#'   result can go straight into the results memo.

#' Configurations spanning the calibration uncertainty.
#'
#' The handout gives ranges as well as point values: the slow half-life h2 is
#' the one that matters most (581 days, with 250-900 worth considering), and
#' the threshold differs by an order of magnitude between the symptomatic and
#' severe endpoints. Return one configuration per scenario, labelled, ready to
#' run through the same sweep.

#' Protection against a clinical endpoint, given a marker level.
#'
#' The logistic relationship of Khoury et al. (2021), turning a titre into a
#' probability of protection. This is the alternative to a hard threshold: it
#' replaces "protected until T*" with a protection curve that declines.

#' @param endpoint "symptomatic" or "severe".

#' Sensitivity of the assay quantification limits.

#' Simulate from the mechanistic antibody-production model.

#' data whose shape the fitted families do not exactly contain.
#'
#' Returns what [simulate_full()] returns, so it can stand in wherever a

#' generator produced it.
